# 🛡️ ACL Simulator

A Python-based CLI tool that simulates **Standard** and **Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)** similar to Cisco router ACL processing. Designed as part of a network security project , this tool demonstrates core networking knowledge, IP filtering, and packet inspection logic used in real-world routers.
